SMART HEALTH PROGNOSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING\n
Accurate and on-time analysis of any health-related problem is important for the prevention and treatment of the illness. Developing a medical diagnosis system based on machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of any disease can help in a more accurate diagnosis than the conventional method. Smart Health Prognosis is a web-based application which is used to predict the disease using the symptoms. From an open-source dataset, an excel sheet was created where we listed down all the symptoms for the respective diseases. The algorithms are Naive bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), where Naive bayes (NB) is a supervised model and used for predicting diseases based on your symptoms, support vector machine (SVM) is also a supervised learning model and used for predicting whether the result is actually correlated or not and Random Forest (RF) is used to improve the predictive accuracy. We ensure to give an accuracy at least the range of 98%. With an increase in biomedical and healthcare data, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection and patient care.
