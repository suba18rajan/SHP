SMART HEALTH PROGNOSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING <br>
Accurate and on-time analysis of any health-related problem is important for the prevention and treatment of the illness. Developing a medical diagnosis system based on machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of any disease can help in a more accurate diagnosis than the conventional method. Smart Health Prognosis is a web-based application which is used to predict the disease using the symptoms. From an open-source dataset, an excel sheet was created where we listed down all the symptoms for the respective diseases. The algorithms are Naive bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), where Naive bayes (NB) is a supervised model and used for predicting diseases based on your symptoms, support vector machine (SVM) is also a supervised learning model and used for predicting whether the result is actually correlated or not and Random Forest (RF) is used to improve the predictive accuracy. We ensure to give an accuracy at least the range of 98%. With an increase in biomedical and healthcare data, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection and patient care.

FUTURE SCOPE
    The future scope of disease prediction holds tremendous potential in advancing healthcare systems. Integrating Big Data Sources and the future of smart health prognosis lies in integrating diverse datasets and technologies. data environmental data social media trends and other sources disease prediction models can provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease patterns and risks. This integration of big data sources promotes a holistic approach to disease prediction and management and the Public Health Planning for smart health prognosis models can be valuable tools for public health planning at both regional and global levels. By analysing data on disease prevalence environmental factors and population demographics these models can identify areas at higher risk of specific diseases.
